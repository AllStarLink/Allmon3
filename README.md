Allmon is the standard web-based montitoring and management for the AllStarLink
application. Allmon3 is the next generation of the venerable Allmon2 that is 
rewritten for performance, scalability, and responsiveness.

## Design Goals
Allmon3 features and functionality shall be governed by the following guidelines:

* Use of modern web responsive design for usability on all device form factors
* Clear separation between long-running tasks and client-based display updates
* Permit reduced workload on potentially slow repeater site links by cleanly supporting the ability to run only the pollers on the device controlling the repeater and run the dashaboard in the cloud; easy prevention of unnecessary web traffic, spidering, etc.
* Prioritization of the common use cases of AllStarLink for feature enhancements

## Community
All code of Allmon3 not otherwise licensed (e.g., Bootstrap, etc.) is licensed
under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html).
The choice of the AGPLv3 promotes giving back to the amateur radio and
ASL communities.

## Requirements
Allmon3 requires the following:

* PHP with the PHP-ZMQ package
* Webserver configured to host PHP-based applications (Apache and Nginx supported)
* Python3 with the Python ZMQ package
